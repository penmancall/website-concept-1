      <div class="col-sm-4 About"><p>My name is Callum, I am a 21 year old industrial design graduate. I'm currently on the lookout for career opportunities in the field of design. I studied at Victoria University, and completed a bachelor of design innovation majoring in industrial design in 2017. <a href="document.pdf" target="_blank">Click here</a> to view my academic history.<br><br> My experience includes three years of experience using CAD packages such as Solidworks and Rhinoceros to design for additive manufacturing technologies as well as other CNC machining techniques. My area of expertise is designing for additive manufacturing. I have a keen eye for attention to detail regarding design.<br> I take a pragmatic approach to problems, and attempt to arrive at a solution which does not sacrifice usability or complicate the final solution simply to add aesthetic value.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 About"><p> Some practical attributes I have include hands on experience operating consumer level 3D printers such as the UP! Box FDM machines, as well as designing parts to be made on printers such as the Stratasys J750 and Connex printers. I also have experience using rendering software such as Keyshot, to produce images and animations of prototypes to demonstrate features of a design.<br><br>
        
    As a side interest and a hobby, I am interested in front end web design and user interface, and I have had around 6 months of experience using HTML, CSS + Bootstrap, and jQuery. Currently my main interest in this field is responsive web design, and learning to create unique user experiences which work on computers and mobile devices. I have used Adobe Illustrator & Photoshop to create simple flat UI style vector graphics and glyphs for websites. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 About"> <p>I also have experience using Arduino & Raspberry Pi with IR motion sensors, heat & moisture sensors, and NEMA stepping motors to create interactive projects. I have some knowledge of C/C++ and Python. I am experienced with basic workshop machinery such as table/band/mitre saws, drill press and hand tools as well as basic bogging/priming and spray-painting experience.<br><br>
            
    I also enjoy photography, I have 3 years experience using Adobe Lightroom and DXO Optics Pro to edit photos. I enjoy scenic portraiture, street photography and product photography. I share the majority of my photos on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/callum_thomas_penman/">Instragram.</a> I use a aps-c sensor Canon 700D and Canon efs 50mm f1.4 lens for all my photos. I also enjoy making espresso, lattes and cappucinos</div>
